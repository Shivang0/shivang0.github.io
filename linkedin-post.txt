Not a whitepaper. Not a consulting pitch. A free, open tool. I've spent the last few months building what I believe every AI team needs but few have: a complete security platform.

Today, I'm releasing 12 new capabilities:

→ Attack Library
→ OWASP LLM Top 10 (2025) Interactive
→ Payload Generator
→ Pentest Scoping Tool
→ Labs Directory
→ Learning Paths
→ Security Glossary
→ Incidents Database
→ Certifications Guide
→ Bug Bounty Directory
→ Community Hub
→ Global Search

This adds to what I shipped earlier: 170+ security controls, 280+ red teaming prompts, benchmarking, threat taxonomy, and posture analysis.

Here's my thesis:

The security gap in AI isn't a tooling problem.

It's an access problem.

The best defenders can't protect what they don't understand and right now, the knowledge is locked behind $5,000 courses and enterprise contracts.

That changes today.

We're shipping AI faster than we're securing it.

That's not innovation. That's technical debt with existential risk.

Everything is free. Everything is open-source.

If you're shipping AI in production, this is your security baseline.

If you're not using something like this, you're one prompt injection away from a headline.

Build fast. But build secure.

What's the biggest security gap you're seeing in AI systems right now?
